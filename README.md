# pymatrixmod
Python module for work with matrix.

## Functionality
pymatrixmod has functions for transposing matrix, multiplying two matrices, raising matrix to the power, computing matrix rank. Also the module has functions for reading a matrix from a file and for printing matrix into console. 
pymatrixmod also has 4 functions for building an observability matrix, controllability matrix and for checking if the system is observable and controllable. But probably you'll not need this functions as they usually used in control theory.
